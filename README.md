# CSBaseProject1

This is a course project for University of Helsinki Cyber Security Base course. The purpose of this project is to use Django to build a website with at least five known vulnerabilities from the [OWASP top ten list](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/) and provide information on how to fix them

The website is a simple app where one can create a user profile and send messages to other users.
